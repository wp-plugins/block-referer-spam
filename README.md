# Block Referer Spam

__Block Referer Spam__ aims at blocking all (or most) websites that use Referer Spam to promote their – often more than dodgy – website content. This is accomplished by bots that very successfully simulate human behavior. They do this so well, that they even show up in __Google Analytics__. This plugin does not need any further configuration. Once active and auto-update is enabled, you will barely see any of those nasty spammers any more.

#### Features
  - Automatic or manual updates of [referer spam list](http://refspam.codestic.com/list/).
  - Option of adding custom referer spam hosts.
  - Two methods of blocking: mod_rewrite or WordPress based.

#### Support
  - Automatic or manual updates of remote referer spam list
  - Option of adding custom referer spam hosts
