Blocks referer spam from accessing your site and cleans up your Google Analytics in the process!

== Description ==

__Block Referer Spam__ aims at blocking all (or most) websites that use Referer Spam to promote their – often more than dodgy – website content. This is accomplished by bots that very successfully simulate human behavior. They do this so well, that they even show up in __Google Analytics__. This plugin does not need any further configuration. Once active and auto-update is enabled, you will barely see any of those nasty spammers any more.

* Automatic or manual updates of referer spam list
* Option of adding custom referer spam hosts
* Two methods of blocking: mod_rewrite or WordPress based

Some of the sites blocked are:

* semalt
* buttons-for-website
* floating-share-buttons
* 4webmaster
* ilovevitaly
* ... any many more!
